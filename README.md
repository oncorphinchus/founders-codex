# 🚀 The Founder's Codex: Lifetime Calendar - LIVE IN PRODUCTION

## ✅ **BACKEND SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED**

**Live API**: [https://founders-codex-rgsxo.ondigitalocean.app/api](https://founders-codex-rgsxo.ondigitalocean.app/api)  
**Health Check**: [https://founders-codex-rgsxo.ondigitalocean.app/api/health](https://founders-codex-rgsxo.ondigitalocean.app/api/health)

A life-planning and execution system designed for ambitious entrepreneurs, built on the philosophy of finite time awareness and strategic goal anchoring. Currently deployed as a production-ready API with mobile app in development.

### 🎯 Core Mission

Transform your relationship with time by visualizing your entire life as 4,680 weeks (90 years), creating positive pressure to focus on what truly matters while anchoring your most important goals to specific future weeks.

### 🏗️ Architecture

This is a monorepo built with Nx containing:

- **API** (NestJS): Backend service with PostgreSQL database
- **Mobile** (React Native): Cross-platform mobile application

### 📱 MVP Features

#### The 90-Year View (Memento Mori Dashboard)
- Visual grid of 4,680 weeks representing a potential 90-year lifespan
- Past weeks automatically greyed out (irreversible "sunk time")
- Current week highlighted in orange
- Future weeks available for goal anchoring

#### Manual Keystone Marking
- Simple text labels for major life goals
- Anchor important achievements to specific future weeks
- Visual representation of long-term vision

#### Onboarding Flow
- Two-step philosophical introduction
- Birth date input for life grid calculation
- Powerful first-time user experience emphasizing finite time

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

5. **For iOS (macOS only):**
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

#### Running the Applications

### 🧠 Philosophical Foundation

#### The Finite Lifespan: The Memento Mori Engine
The core organizing principle is the visceral, visual representation of a finite 90-year lifespan. This creates what Oliver Burkeman terms "positive pressure" - shifting focus from the impossible goal of "getting everything done" to the essential task of doing what truly matters.

#### The Practitioner-Scholar
Designed for founders who understand that building a company is an applied intellectual pursuit, bridging the gap between learning and doing through structured frameworks and feedback loops.

#### The Antifragile User
Built to help users navigate "The Struggle" (Ben Horowitz) and emerge stronger, systematically reframing setbacks as features that trigger growth subroutines.

#### Integrated Well-Being
Extraordinary achievement cannot be sustained at the cost of well-being. The system ensures professional goals are integrated with, not opposed to, holistic flourishing.

### 🎨 Design Principles

#### Language of Growth
- No judgmental or negative language in UI
- "Overdue" becomes "Awaiting Action"
- "Failed" becomes "Learning in Progress"
- Reinforces growth mindset through every interaction

#### From Vision to Action
- Seamless navigation between macro (90-year) and micro (daily) perspectives
- Visual reinforcement of the connection between long-term purpose and immediate execution

#### The Coach in the Code
- Proactive guidance and intelligent interventions
- Built-in wisdom from foundational frameworks
- Helps users apply principles in real-time
