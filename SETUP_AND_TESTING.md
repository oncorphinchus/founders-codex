# The Founder's Codex: MVP Setup & Testing Guide

## 🎯 What We've Built

The MVP "The Visualizer" is a complete monorepo implementation featuring:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **90-Year Life Grid** - Visual representation of 4,680 weeks (90 years)

   - Current week highlighted in orange  
   - Future weeks available for goal setting
   - Touch interactions for goal creation

2. **Philosophical Onboarding** - Two-step introduction process
   - Welcome screen with core philosophy explanation
   - Birth date input with real-time life statistics
   - Powerful "greying out" moment for past weeks

3. **Manual Keystone Goal Setting** - Simple goal anchoring system
   - Click any future week to set a major life goal
   - Visual markers on the grid
   - Local storage persistence for MVP

4. **Complete Architecture** - Full-stack foundation ready for Phase 2
   - NestJS API with TypeORM and PostgreSQL integration
   - React Native mobile app with cross-platform compatibility
   - Nx monorepo structure for scalability

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Prerequisites Verification
```bash
# Verify Node.js version (18+)
node --version

# Verify npm
npm --version

# Check if PostgreSQL is available (optional for mobile-only testing)
psql --version
```

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd founders-codex
npm install
cd mobile
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Test API Build
```bash
npx nx build api
# Should output: "webpack compiled successfully"
```

### 3. Test Mobile App (Development Mode)
```bash
npx nx serve mobile
# This starts the web version for testing
# Navigate to http://localhost:4200
```

### 4. Test Mobile App (Native Mode)
For iOS:
```bash
npx nx run mobile:run-ios
```

For Android:
```bash
npx nx run mobile:run-android
```

## 📱 User Journey Testing

### Test Scenario 1: First-Time User Experience

1. **Launch the App**
   - Should see loading screen briefly
   - Then navigate to onboarding

2. **Onboarding Step 1: Philosophy Introduction**
   - Welcome screen with "Transform Your Relationship with Time"
   - Three key bullet points about finite perspective
   - Oliver Burkeman quote
   - "Begin Your Journey" button

3. **Onboarding Step 2: Birth Date Input**
   - "Your Life Timeline" screen
   - Date picker with current date as default
   - Real-time calculation of weeks lived/remaining
   - "Create My Grid" button

4. **The Dramatic Moment**
   - Alert: "Your Life Grid is Ready"
   - Philosophy reinforcement about finite time
   - "I Understand" acknowledgment

5. **Life Grid Exploration**
   - 4,680 week grid organized by age/year
   - Past weeks greyed out (unchangeable)
   - Current week highlighted in orange
   - Future weeks available for interaction

### Test Scenario 2: Goal Setting

1. **Tap a Future Week**
   - Should show "Set Keystone Goal" alert
   - Week number displayed (e.g., "week 2,400")

2. **Create a Goal**
   - Enter goal text (e.g., "Launch My Company")
   - Goal appears as blue square with first letter
   - Success message with philosophy reinforcement

3. **Goal Persistence**
   - Close and reopen app
   - Goals should persist via AsyncStorage
   - Grid should maintain all set goals

### Test Scenario 3: Past Week Protection

1. **Tap a Greyed-Out Week**
   - Should show "Cannot Modify Past" alert
   - Philosophy message about forward focus
   - "Understood" button

## 🧪 Technical Validation

### API Health Check
```bash
# Start the API
npx nx serve api

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return app info
```

### Database Connection (Optional)
```bash
# Create database
createdb founders_codex

# Start API with database
# Check logs for successful TypeORM connection
```

### Mobile App Validation

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Mobile Build Issues:

- **iOS pod issues**: Run `cd mobile/ios && pod install --repo-update`
- **Android issues**: Ensure Android SDK is properly configured

### API Issues:
- **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
- **Port conflicts**: API runs on port 3000, mobile on 4200

### General Issues:
- **Node modules**: Try `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- **Metro cache**: Run `npx react-native start --reset-cache`

## 📊 Success Metrics for MVP
