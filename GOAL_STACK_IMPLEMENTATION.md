# The Founder's Codex: Goal Stack Implementation
## Phase 2 Development Complete ‚úÖ

### üéØ Overview
The Goal Stack represents the digital embodiment of "The Practitioner-Scholar" principle, creating a hierarchical system that enforces strategic alignment from 10-year vision down to daily atomic tasks. This implementation ensures every action serves a greater purpose while preventing the creation of "busywork" that doesn't advance long-term objectives.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implemented

### Backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL)

#### 1. **Database Schema** - `api/src/entities/goal.entity.ts`
```typescript
// CONTEXT: Self-referencing hierarchical structure
@Entity('goals')
export class Goal {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  type: 'KEYSTONE' | 'ANNUAL' | 'QUARTERLY' | 'WEEKLY' | 'DAILY_ATOMIC';
  title: string;
  status: 'NOT_STARTED' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'COMPLETE' | 'LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS';
  parentId?: string; // Self-referencing for hierarchy
  children: Goal[];
  // ... additional fields
}
```

**Philosophical Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **"Language of Growth"**: No "FAILED" status - uses "LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS"
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchy Enforcement**: `parentId` creates the Vision-to-Action Funnel
- ‚úÖ **Hypothesis Tracking**: Built-in support for validated learning

#### 2. **Business Logic** - `api/src/services/goals.service.ts`
```typescript
// CONTEXT: Enforces strategic hierarchy validation
async create(userId: string, createGoalDto: CreateGoalDto): Promise<Goal> {
  // Prevents orphan goals - every goal must serve a higher purpose
  if (type !== GoalType.KEYSTONE && !parentId) {
    throw new BadRequestException(
      'All goals except Keystones must have a parent.'
    );
  }
  // ... hierarchy validation
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchy Validation**: Prevents invalid parent-child relationships
- ‚úÖ **Learning Capture**: Requires insights when goals transition to learning mode
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Protection**: Cannot delete goals with active children

#### 3. **API Endpoints** - `api/src/controllers/goals.controller.ts`
```typescript
@Controller('goals')
export class GoalsController {
  @Get('hierarchy') // Returns Keystones with nested children
  @Get('today')     // Daily atomic tasks for execution focus
  @Patch(':id/learning') // Implements Antifragile principle
  // ... full CRUD with philosophical validation
}
```

## üì± Frontend (React Native)

#### 1. **Goal Stack Screen** - `mobile/src/screens/GoalStackScreen.tsx`
- **Hierarchical Display**: Collapsible tree structure with visual indentation
- **Status Management**: "Language of Growth" compliant status updates
- **Learning Capture**: Prompts for insights when goals transition to learning mode

#### 2. **Goal Hierarchy Card** - `mobile/src/components/GoalHierarchyCard.tsx`
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded goal types with indentation levels
- **Status Indicators**: Growth-focused status badges
- **Action Buttons**: Context-appropriate actions (Complete, Learning Mode, Add Child)

#### 3. **Create Goal Modal** - `mobile/src/components/CreateGoalModal.tsx`
- **SMART Goal Framework**: Guided input for measurable goals
- **Hierarchy Context**: Shows parent goal for strategic alignment
- **Hypothesis Tracking**: Optional experimental design fields

## üß™ Philosophical Principles Implemented

### 1. **"The Practitioner-Scholar" Principle**
```typescript
// CONTEXT: Every goal must serve a higher purpose
if (type !== GoalType.KEYSTONE && !parentId) {
  throw new BadRequestException(
    'All goals except Keystones must have a parent. This enforces strategic alignment.'
  );
}
```
**Implementation**: Strict hierarchy validation prevents orphaned goals

### 2. **"Language of Growth" Principle**
```typescript
export enum GoalStatus {
  NOT_STARTED = 'NOT_STARTED',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  COMPLETE = 'COMPLETE',
  LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS = 'LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS' // NO "FAILED" status
}
```
**Implementation**: All UI copy uses positive, growth-focused language

### 3. **"The Antifragile User" Principle**
```typescript
// CONTEXT: Transforms setbacks into wisdom
async markLearningInProgress(id: string, userId: string, learnings: string) {
  if (!learnings) {
    throw new BadRequestException(
      'When a goal transitions to "Learning in Progress", please capture what was learned.'
    );
  }
}
```
**Implementation**: Required learning capture for all setbacks

### 4. **"Coach in the Code" Principle**
```typescript
// CONTEXT: Proactive guidance
if (status === 'LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS' && !learnings) {
  Alert.alert(
    'Learning Opportunity',
    'What did you learn from this experience? Capturing insights transforms setbacks into wisdom.'
  );
}
```
**Implementation**: Smart prompts guide users toward growth mindset

## üéØ Goal Hierarchy Structure

```
üéØ KEYSTONE (10-year anchor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÖ ANNUAL (This year's objective)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ QUARTERLY (This quarter's rock)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∞ WEEKLY (This week's sprint)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ö° DAILY_ATOMIC (Today's action)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∞ WEEKLY (Another sprint)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ QUARTERLY (Next quarter)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÖ ANNUAL (Next year)
```

**Validation Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **KEYSTONE**: No parent required (vision anchor)
- ‚úÖ **ANNUAL**: Must be child of KEYSTONE
- ‚úÖ **QUARTERLY**: Must be child of ANNUAL
- ‚úÖ **WEEKLY**: Must be child of QUARTERLY
- ‚úÖ **DAILY_ATOMIC**: Must be child of WEEKLY

## üöÄ Usage Example

### Creating a Complete Goal Stack

1. **Keystone Goal**:
   ```
   Title: "Build a $10M sustainable climate tech business"
   Type: KEYSTONE
   Week: 2600 (age 50)
   ```

2. **Annual Goal**:
   ```
   Title: "Launch MVP and validate product-market fit"
   Type: ANNUAL
   Parent: Keystone Goal
   Hypothesis: True
   ```

3. **Quarterly Goal**:
   ```
   Title: "Complete customer discovery and technical prototype"
   Type: QUARTERLY
   Parent: Annual Goal
   ```

4. **Weekly Goal**:
   ```
   Title: "Interview 5 potential customers"
   Type: WEEKLY
   Parent: Quarterly Goal
   ```

5. **Daily Task**:
   ```
   Title: "Reach out to 3 manufacturing executives on LinkedIn"
   Type: DAILY_ATOMIC
   Parent: Weekly Goal
   ```

### Learning from Setbacks
When a goal doesn't meet expectations:
```typescript
// System automatically prompts for learning capture
goal.status = 'LEARNING_IN_PROGRESS';
goal.learnings = 'Market timing was wrong, need to validate demand first';
```
