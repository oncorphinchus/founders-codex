## üõ† **IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### Step 1: Set Up Local Development with Live Database
```bash
# Connect local development to production database for testing
# (with appropriate safety measures)

1. Create a staging database on DigitalOcean
2. Update local .env to point to staging DB
3. Test all API endpoints with real SSL connection
4. Ensure full development-to-production parity
```

### Step 2: Implement Authentication (Start Here)
```bash
# This is the critical missing piece for a functional application

1. Install authentication dependencies:
   npm install --save passport passport-jwt bcryptjs @nestjs/passport @nestjs/jwt

2. Create User entity and authentication module
3. Add JWT token generation and validation
4. Protect all API routes with authentication middleware
5. Test with Postman/Insomnia
```

### Step 3: Build Goal Stack Endpoints
```bash
# Core functionality for "The Practitioner-Scholar" system

1. Complete Goal CRUD operations
2. Add hierarchy validation logic  
3. Implement status management with "Language of Growth"
4. Add hypothesis tracking for validated learning
5. Test goal creation and completion workflows
```

## üß™ **TESTING & VALIDATION STRATEGY**

### Backend API Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive testing before mobile integration
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations  
- [ ] E2E tests for complete user workflows
- [ ] Load testing for production readiness
- [ ] Security testing for authentication flows
```

### Mobile App Testing
```bash
# Ensure high-quality mobile experience
- [ ] Component testing with Jest/Testing Library
- [ ] Integration testing with live API
- [ ] Device testing (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Offline functionality testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
```
